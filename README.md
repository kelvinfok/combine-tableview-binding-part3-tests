# Combine & Tableview binding Part 3/3 - Writing unit tests

Welcome to part 3/3 of this series.

In this project and video, I talk about structuring our ViewModel, to increase testablity and also explained about we should think about writing test cases. It's both an art and science. 

Finally, I go through 3 tests that I've written and demonstrate how to use XCTestExpectation to test async code and how to structure a mock to be used with dependency injection.
